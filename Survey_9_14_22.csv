We are asking you to be in a research study. Participation is voluntary. The purpose of this form is to give you the information you will need to help you decide whether to participate. Please read the form carefully. You may ask questions about anything that is not clear. When we have answered all of your questions, you can decide if you want to be in the study or not. This process is called “informed consent.”

You are invited to participate in a research project entitled “Race and Geoscience Identity in Undergraduates”. The study is being conducted by Willa Rowan and Dr. Robyn Dahl from Western Washington University and has been approved by the Western Washington University Institutional Review Board (IRB). 

This survey will take 8-10 minutes to complete. Your replies will be anonymous, meaning we will not record identifiers such as your name, contact information, or IP address. Responses will be stored on a password-protected server. Participants may experience emotional discomfort if survey questions relate to negative experiences they have had in their geoscience programs. Participation is completely voluntary and there will be no penalty or loss of benefits if you choose to not participate in this research study or to withdraw.  If you choose not to participate you can leave the survey site.  You may choose to not answer any question by simply leaving it blank. Finishing the survey entitles you to enter a raffle for several $50 Amazon e-gift cards, and your raffle entry will not be linked to your survey responses. If you have any questions about the study you may contact Willa Rowan at rowanw@wwu.edu

If you have any questions concerning your rights as a research participant you may contact the Western Washington University Office of Research and Sponsored Programs (RSP) at compliance@wwu.edu or (360) 650-2146. 
 Selecting “yes” below and completing the on-line survey indicate your consent for use of the answers you supply. By completing this survey you are also confirming that you are 18 years of age or older.

Furthermore, when I do hear people talk about national parks and land-based knowledge they talk about it in a very clinical way that is disconnected from the people who owned the land.  Sometimes I see people pull up pictures of places and landforms in the pacific northwest(the columbia river) that are from my reservation and they don't even mention how my people have 20,000+ years of history in the area. One time, when looking at Walla Walla, someone in my class even said ""what a dumb name, who named that?"" and I had to raise my hand to say ""well, Wéele is the word for river in our plateau langauges, that's where this comes from. It means full of rivers."" And the class just went silent. I also shared a myth about the glacial outwash boulders in the state. Everything is really disconnected, and I definitely feel alone most times in geoscience as a trans person and as a native american person. I know it takes presences like mine to change that, but it's hard. It is insulting sometimes that we are studying the land of my ancestors and its never mentioned who lived in the national parks or owned them before people put a fence and a plaque on ol' faithful.

I switched my major to geology in 2019. There are only two female individuals in the geology department. One was an engineer I never had a class with, and the other was considered so unbearable that she was not allowed to teach and was to conduct research in a tiny room on the third floor. There was no representation in my school as far as I felt. Additionally, our building does not have a women's bathroom on the second floor because it has not been renovated since 1960 and during those times, women didn't do research in labs, so they just never added a bathroom. To this day, 50 years later, there is still no bathroom, no matter how much we advocate for one. There is a lock on the door, but the embarrassment of walking in on your male professor urinating feels uncomfortable for me. Men don't lock the door when they use the restroom because they have never thought about it.
