Sometimes I see people pull up pictures of places and landforms in the pacific northwest(the columbia river) that are from my reservation and they don't even mention how my people have 20,000+ years of history in the area. One time, when looking at Walla Walla, someone in my class even said ""what a dumb name, who named that?"" and I had to raise my hand to say ""well, Wéele is the word for river in our plateau langauges, that's where this comes from. It means full of rivers."" And the class just went silent. I also shared a myth about the glacial outwash boulders in the state.
